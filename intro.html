                <h1>Welcome to Di Di!</h1>
                <h2>Are you the new hire?</h2>
                <p>Congratulations on your first day! Let me give you the run down on this restaurant. 
                    <br>Mimi and her mom started this restaurant to share her mom's recipes with others! However 
                    <br>Mimi's mom is very traditional so they like to bud heads about what's best for the 
                    <br>restaurant sometimes so WATCH OUT! The restaurant's name, Di Di, means "Go Go" in vietnamese
                    <br>and boy does it represent how busy the restaurant gets (that's why you are here!). You will 
                    <br>learn how to prepare all the food in the restaurant today but just watch out for the bad 
                    <br>spirts lurking around. Mimi's mom says its because the restaraunt's non-traditional ways have
                    <br>pissed off the ancestors but Mimi says she is just finding an excuse to change things around here.
